Amazon - made by amazon
Web - https
Services - storage, servers, cloud9

Each aws services has an own api. https request to the api can access the services
Can use aws mgmt console or aws cli (via the aws sdk) to call the apis
aws sdk platform dependent

Passing my credentials to client

	1. Service-client constructor (in the code of client / hardcoding)
	2. Environment Variables
	3. Credentials file (shared - ok for developing not prod)
	4. If the code is running on docker container hosted in Elastic container service it will
	   check the ECS credential provider for credentials
	5. IAM role associated with the instance (Recommended)

Cloud9 instance is run on top of a EC2 instance

AWS is automatically managing the credentials of cloud98. if it is disabled then we cannot run code in cloud9 as there are no credentials. Two ways to fix this

	1. Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance
	2. Can use aws configure to create the credential file manually
	

AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is a open source framework to create serverless applications

Serverless Application : 
	This has a server but server management is done by cloud provider. developer will be more 		looking in to the business logic of the application (FaaS). In FaaS has a event driven 		architecture. Look for the events and handle them.

SAM has 2 components 
	1. AWS SAM Template Specification - define the serverless application
	2. AWS SAM Command Line Interface - used to build the application according to the 		                                    specification
