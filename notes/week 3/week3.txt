aws lambda: compute service. allows to execute only when needed and has the ability to scale. Administrate the resources that require for computing, server and operating system maintenance and logging

Integrate it to REST api
we have to code the lambda
Event concurrency and trigger - 
	Event is a JSON formatted doc containing data for a function to process
At runtime lambda turn this into an object and pass it to the function. So when the function is invoked the structure and content of the event.

	Concurrency is the number of reqs a function is serving at a given time
